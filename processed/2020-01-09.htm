     Meanwhile, the HA Central Committee on Infectious Disease and Emergency Responses held another ad hoc meeting today to discuss the latest progress of the cluster of cases of Severe Respiratory Disease associated with a Novel Infectious Agent in Wuhan.<br/>
 <br/>
     The HA reiterated that the current stockpile of personal protection equipment (PPE), such as surgical masks and N95 respirators, is adequate for three months' consumption, which has been calculated with reference to the usage during the swine influenza pandemic in 2009. The HA has also set up hotlines for front-line staff to enquire about issues of PPE and linen supply.<br/>
 <br/>
     Regarding isolation beds, 503 isolation beds with negative pressure facilities are immediately available currently and the present occupancy is 60 per cent. The HA will closely monitor the utilisation and could mobilise the other 900 isolation beds with negative pressure facilities if needed.<br/>
 <br/>
     The HA will maintain close contact with the Centre for Health Protection to monitor the latest developments and to inform the public and healthcare workers on the latest information in a timely manner.
