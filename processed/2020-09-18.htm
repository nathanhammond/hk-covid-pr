				The following is issued on behalf of the Hospital Authority:<br/>
<br/>
     As at 9am today (September 18), 14 COVID-19 confirmed patients were discharged from hospital in the last 24 hours. So far, a total of 4 696 patients with confirmed or probable infection have been discharged.<br/>
 <br/>
     At present, there are 652 negative pressure rooms in public hospitals with 1 158 negative pressure beds activated. A total of 167 confirmed patients are currently hospitalised in 17 public hospitals and a community treatment facility, among which 13 patients are in critical condition, nine are in serious condition and the remaining 145 patients are in stable condition.<br/>
 <br/>
     In addition, an 81-year-old male patient (case number: 4630) confirmed with COVID-19 infection passed away in Princess Margaret Hospital (PMH) yesterday (September 17). The patient with chronic illness was admitted to PMH on August 19 due to chest infection and irregular heartbeat, and later tested positive for COVID-19. The patient was released from an isolation order by the Department of Health yesterday. However, his condition deteriorated due to bacterial pneumonia and he eventually succumbed at 8.44pm last night. Including this patient, 102 COVID-19 patients have passed away in public hospitals so far.<br/>
