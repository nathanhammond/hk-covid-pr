     The spokesperson for Hospital Authority (HA) reminded that restricted visiting arrangements are now imposed in all public hospitals. "Members of the public are advised to avoid visiting patients in ward if they have fever, or have close contact with patients with respiratory symptoms in countries/areas with possible transmission of novel coronavirus infection."<br/>
      <br/>
     Visitors of public hospitals are also required to wear masks in all clinical areas and to wash hands before and after visiting hospitals.<br/>
      <br/>
     The HA will maintain close contact with the Centre for Health Protection to monitor the latest developments and to inform the public and healthcare workers on the latest information in a timely manner.
